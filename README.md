**Fondacija EKIPA**

We believe that every story told in a creative and meaningful way has a potential of creating a massive impact and reaching a broad audience. With a modern, practically
limitless toolset for storytelling and with the right talent involved, everything is in place for telling stories that matter and inspire. Only by establishing a two-way communication and by breaking beyond the echo chamber can a new light be shed upon the issues that we oftentimes find insurmountable.

Majority of our projects are entirely based on modern technologies. Our ability of Full Cycle Software Development gives us full control over the IT segment of our projects. Ultimately, it gives us the ability to fully integrate the technology into any stage of our creative planning.

Our technology stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
Backend: PHP, JS, Python; Frameworks: Laravel, Django, Node JS
Microservices: REST API
Webservers: Apache, Nginx
Databases: PostgresSQL, MySQL, (Redis).
Mobile: Flutter
